## Support Open Stage Control

If you would like to show your appreciation, drop a line on the forums, it's always appreciated !

Donations are not possible per see, but you may buy some music made by [AMMD](http://ammd.bandcamp.com), a french nonprofit organization and independent music label that promotes free arts and free softwares.

If you wish to sponsor the project or hire me to build something with Open Stage Control, feel free to [contact me](mailto:jean-emmanuel@ammd.net) but please note that:

- Sponsoring is only possible in an "altruistic" way, that is with no guarantee whatsoever of prioritizing anyone's interests
- I'm not interested in developing dedicated features for proprietary softwares
- I'm not interested in developing closed-source contents
