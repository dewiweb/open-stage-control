## Built-in themes

Themes can be loaded with the `--theme` option. Multiple themes can be combined. Built-in themes can be loaded using their name, custom theme files can be loaded using their path.

Available themes (full color scheme):

- `orange`: grey and orange theme
- `light`: light and blue
- `dark`: blue night theme

Available extensions (alternative visual settings)

- `flat`: remove 3d effects
- `alt-buttons`: colorful active buttons
- `responsive-fonts`: bigger texts for bigger screens

## Creating a custom theme

Creating a custom theme is as simple as writing a tiny css file that will override the default css variables defined in [default.scss](https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/open-stage-control/blob/master/src/scss/themes/default.scss) :

```css
:root {
	--color-accent:red;
}
```

This will change the default accent color to red. Variables can also be overridden for a specific subset of elements, for example :

```css
.panel-container {
	--color-text:blue;
}
```

This will change the default text color to blue for all elements in panel widgets.

## Scss / autoreload

When running the app [from sources](/docs/getting-started), custom themes can be written in scss:

- the scss file must be located in `src/browser/scss/themes/`
- run `npm run watch-css`

The theme will be watched and compiled automatically to a css file located in app/browser/themes/ (css files in this directory can be selected from the theme option by their name, without .css suffix). If the app is running on default http port, clients will reload the theme automatically.
